RECURSION
=> Hapens when a fucntion is made to call it self

int factorial(int n)

if (n == 1)
{
	return 1
}
n * factorial(n - 1)

So factori of 3 is the same as 3! = 3 * 2 * 1
Factorial of 4 = 4! = 4 * 3!

So the art is to understand the project from start to end. Just understand it before coding. Understna dwhat it should behave like. Also examine examples to see if what you think it should do aligns with the goals of your project according to your interpretation
